The *cmdkit* library implements a few common patterns needed by well-formed command-line
applications in Python. It only touches a few concepts but it implements them well.
The idea is to reduce the boilerplate needed to get a full featured CLI off the ground.
Applications developed using *cmdkit* are easy to implement, easy to maintain, and easy to
understand.

Installation
------------

*CmdKit* is tested for `Windows`, `macOS`, and `Linux`, and can be installed
from the `Python Package Index` using `Pip`.

::

    $ pip install cmdkit
