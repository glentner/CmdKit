Release Notes (v2.7.7)
======================

`December 26, 2024`

The v2.7.7 release retroactively allows for Python 3.9.

-----

Allow Python 3.9
----------------

There were no hard requirements that prevented the use of Python 3.9.
The project listed Python 3.10+ because of development dependencies
that disallowed 3.9 but we decided to retroactively fix this to
allow for wider deployment potential.
