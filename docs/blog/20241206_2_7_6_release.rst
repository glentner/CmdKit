Release Notes (v2.7.6)
======================

`December 6, 2024`

The v2.7.6 release switches to ``tomli`` and ``tomli-w`` for TOML language support.

-----

TOML Language Support
---------------------

Previously we relied on the `toml <https://pypi.org/project/toml/>`_ package for parsing TOML
configuration files. However, this package is no longer considered the best provider of such support
and is actually now `deprecated <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DeprecatePythonToml>`_
by some Linux distros. Further, TOML has made its way into the Python standard library
(for Python 3.11+, `tomllib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html>`_).
Therefore it was best to migrate to no dependency at all for Python 3.11+ or use
`tomli <https://pypi.org/project/tomli/>`_ otherwise.
For *write* capabilities we've added `tomli-w <https://pypi.org/project/tomli-w/>`_.
Many application have no need to write TOML, so this is an optional dependency.

Proper support for package `extras` is now provided.
To explicitly enable TOML, developers can specify ``cmdkit[toml]`` as a dependency.
