Release Notes (v2.7.5)
======================

`April 17, 2024`

The v2.7.5 release updates the ``ansi`` module to address minor issues.

-----

Improved usage and help text syntax highlighting
------------------------------------------------

The ``ansi`` module holds a collection of regular expressions
that apply automatic formatting to usage and help text with
standard syntax.

This change addresses the following:

* Metavars match on 2 letters instead of requiring 3.
  For example, `ID` is now matched.
* The pattern matching here is very generalized with the
  exception of a very short list of special resource names
  (i.e., `localhost`, `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`).
  But if an option is named ``--stdout`` for example,
  the highlighting is not handled properly. This change
  adds a negative look-behind to catch this edge case.
